# Group Investment Smart Pools

## 📖 Project Description
The **Group Investment Smart Pools** project enables multiple participants to collectively pool their funds for shared investments using Ethereum smart contracts. It automates fund collection, balance tracking, and proportional distribution without intermediaries.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To democratize access to group investments through transparent, decentralized smart contracts—empowering small investors to collaborate and grow their assets together.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Decentralized Pooling:** Investors can contribute ETH directly to a shared pool.
- **Automatic Tracking:** The contract records all investments transparently on-chain.
- **Fair Distribution:** Funds can be distributed proportionally based on each investor’s contribution.
- **Manager Role:** A designated manager oversees fund distribution for accountability.
- **No Middlemen:** Operates trustlessly through smart contracts.

## 🛠️ Core Functions
1. **invest()** – Allows users to contribute ETH to the shared pool.  
2. **getPoolBalance()** – Displays the total ETH held in the pool.  
3. **distributeFunds()** – Manager can distribute funds back to investors proportionally.
